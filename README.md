Everyday tools with Python!

## 🔍1. Compare Lists

### Description

This script compares two provided lists and generates a file containing the differences between them. It identifies elements present in one list but absent in the other and creates detailed messages indicating these differences.

### Functionality

- Receives two lists as input.
- Compares the lists and identifies exclusive elements of each one.
- Generates detailed messages indicating the differences.
- Saves the difference messages in a file at the root of the project.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

## 2. ✅Format IDs

### Description

This script formats a list of IDs, adding single quotes and commas to the elements, and saves the result to a file. The last line will not have a comma at the end.

### Functionality

- Receives a list of IDs as input.
- Formats the IDs by adding single quotes and commas.
- Ensures that the last line does not have a comma at the end.
- Saves the formatted list to a file at the root of the project.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

## 3. 🎲Generate Inserts

### Description

This script reads a JSON file containing product information, generates SQL INSERT statements for each object in the JSON, and saves these statements to an SQL file.

### Functionality

- Loads the content of a JSON file.
- Generates SQL INSERT statements for each object in the JSON.
- Saves the SQL statements to a file at the root of the project.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- JSON file with product data.

## 4. 🗝️Generate Random Passwords

### Description

This Python program generates random passwords based on user-specified criteria. Users can choose the type of password they want (e.g., numbers and letters, only letters, only numbers, or numbers, letters, and symbols), specify the length of the passwords, and determine how many passwords to generate.

### Functionality

- Users can choose from four types of passwords:
  1. Numbers and letters
  2. Only letters
  3. Only numbers
  4. Numbers, letters, and symbols
- Allows users to specify the length of the passwords.
- Generates random passwords based on the specified type and length.
- Outputs the generated passwords to the terminal.

## 5. 🔄Identify Duplicate Redeems and Calculate Excess Points

### Description

This script analyzes a CSV file to identify duplicate redeems and calculate excess points refunded to customers. It compares the amount of points subtracted during the redeem process against the points added back through refunds. If the refunded points exceed the redeemed points, the script calculates the excess and generates a detailed report.

### Functionality

- Loads a CSV file containing point wallet logs.
- Identifies redeems where the refunded points exceed the points redeemed.
- Calculates the excess points for each redeem where a discrepancy is found.
- Saves the result in a report file, including the `RedeemId`, total refunded points, redeemed points, and the excess points identified.

### Requirements

- CSV file generated by the following SQL query:
  ```sql
  select
      *
  from
      point_wallet_log pwl
  where
      pwl."originCustomerId" = 'originCustomerId'
          and pwl."redeemId" is not null
      or pwl."redeemId" in (
      select
          distinct p."redeemId"
      from
          point_wallet_log p
      where
          p."originCustomerId" = 'originCustomerId'
  );
  ```

## 6. 📝Format CSV Numbers with Quotes and Commas

### Description

This script reads a CSV file containing a list of numbers, formats them by adding single quotes around each number and a comma after each (except for the last number), and saves the result to a text file. The formatted list can be used in queries or other processes where quoted numbers are needed.

### Functionality

- Reads a CSV file containing a list of numbers.
- Formats each number by adding single quotes around it and a comma after it, except for the last number.
- Saves the formatted numbers to a text file named `format_list_number.txt`.

### Requirements

- A CSV file containing numbers in each row.

## 7. 🔄Convert INSERT Statements to UPDATE Statements

### Description

This script transforms SQL `INSERT` statements into corresponding `UPDATE` statements. It extracts the table name, columns, and values from the `INSERT` statements, then generates `UPDATE` statements by setting the column values and using the `id` as the condition in the `WHERE` clause. The resulting `UPDATE` statements are saved in a `.sql` file.

### Functionality

- Extracts table name, columns, and values from the provided `INSERT` statements.
- Converts the `INSERT` statements into `UPDATE` statements, using the `id` column to update the correct record.
- Saves the generated `UPDATE` statements to a SQL file (`transform-update.sql`).

### Requirements

- Input: A string containing one or more `INSERT` statements to be converted.

### Example

If the `INSERT` statement is:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30);

-- The script will generate the following UPDATE statement:
UPDATE customers SET name = 'John Doe', age = 30 WHERE id = 1;
```

### How to Use

- Insert your INSERT statements in the insert_statements variable in the script.
- Run the script.
- The generated UPDATE statements will be saved in transform-update.sql.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
